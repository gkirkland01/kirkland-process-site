						Operation Tiny Home is a nonprofit that aims at helping those in unstable housing situations and strive to provide high-quailty tiny housing solutions while empowering participants with work training simultaneously. Providing aid to veterans as well as other civil service workers who are either homeless or in an unstable living situation that meets the organization's need requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						The original design and layout of their website is simple and minimalistic, utilizing negative space and clear visibility of the different articles. Whenever you first land onto the page, there is a narrow video jumbotron layout that displays different videos and pictures of people working on the tiny houses. Underneath this is Operation Tiny Home's mission statement followed by differnt articles with links that direct the user to different avenues of the website, which becomes hard to follow and really find what the user visited the site for. There is a horizontal navigation bar that is different from the hamburger drop down navigation, which again adds to the confusion of finding the necessary and wanted information.

						This nonprofit organization caters to those needing stable housing and want to apply for the program while also catering to those who want to volunteer or donate to the cause. However, with the original site design, it is hard to find the right avenues to either apply or to volunteer. Once the user finds the link they need, the site changes its side navigation bar. As shown below in the screengrabs, the first image's side navigation states Programs and the subtopics associated with that, while the screengrab talking about joining to volunteer and to help veterans in need, the sidebar completely disappears. There are many discrepancies in terms of locating information.

						Operation Tiny Home is very active on social media. Posting about what their building partners are doing, how donors are supporting them, and participant testimonies. This bolsters engagement with audiences that want to physically of financially provide support. As well as provides credibility to those who are seeking the organization as a way to help them achieve stable housing and learn career skills.

					In creating and designing the new layout for Operation Tiny Home's website I want to have a landing page that allows clear navigation for the different audiences to reach the information they need without having to shift through what they are not interested in. Below are some inspiration layouts. These are clear examples of landing pages that direct their audiences in different directions based on a category that they identify with most. The idea with the two buttons as shown in the gdgets.co example, would work well with the clarity of separtating elements.

					While in the Ikea example there are different sections of the landing page designated for different objectives and that could also be an interesting option to separate the different audience's information.
