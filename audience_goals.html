						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">Research describing the Determined Audiences, Operation Tiny Home's Overarching and Specific Goals.</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						<b>Determined Audiences</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing extensive research about Operation Tiny Home and their programs, I was able to distinguish who their audiences are. This is research is essential in order to create an effective web design, catered to their target audiences. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/audience_research.png" alt="" />
						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two audience groups for those directly involved, those giving help and those who have and will recieve help. Those giving help, would be volunteers (providing physical and financial help), benefactors (providing solely financial help), and Operation Tiny Home staff. Those having recieved help or are seeking help are veterans (Operation Tiny House offers a Veteran program), City/civil workers, as well as low-income families that are either homeless already or on the verge.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Next is the audience that is peripherally invovled, those that are impacted by this organization but is not directly targeted. That includes contrators, local and state government officials, as well as the local community members.
					</p>
					<p>
						Those are not the only audiences. There are always fans and skeptics towards any service or organization. Those for Operation Tiny Home could include the support of the tiny house community, a community that strives to help the people around them as well as the environment. Fans can also include homeless shelters as well as veteran service providers. These groups could be fans of the organization because they are all providers that seek to help their specific audiences find a stable environment. However, when the skeptics are added, both groups of skeptics and fans start to overlap. Government officials can be skeptics because of the lack of regulations for tiny houses, they can been deemed unfit places to live. Homeless shelters can also be skeptics as well as fans because funds could be taken away from them if there are less people they need to help in the community. Another group of skeptics could be the local community members of Operation Tiny Home's nationwide workshops because their property values could begin to lose value.
					</p>
					<p>
						The audiences previously mentioned have some knowledge of Operation Tiny Home but the organization is also needing the attention of some specific groups to be able to further their cause. Such as the local communinties that their workshops are hosted in to raise awareness of their homeless population in their areas and encourage support. They also need law makers to be aware of Operation Tiny Home due to the lack of regulation of tiny houses and many owners get evicted due to the lack of laws and communication. The attention of professional tiny house building companies nationwide would also help their organization reguarding relationships and partnering with them in the companies' local areas. Lastly, if Veteran Affairs knew about Operation Tiny Home then they could direct veterans in need to them and help lower the veteran homeless population.

					<b>Successful and Failed Solutions</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					University of Colorado Boulder student, Andrew Heben, worked on an urban planning project called SquareOne Villages. The project provided tiny houses for over 100 homeless in Eugene, Oregon. This project came about when Heben visited a tent city in Cincinnati and saw problems that he wanted find a solution for. Currently Heben is working towards building a toolkit for helping local governments to make tiny villages a reality in more locations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Heben's solution is very similar to Operation Tiny Home's solution of providing homes and career training to build a foundation for homeless veterans.
				</p>
				<p>
					What does not work is governments banning homeless from resting in public spaces by placing criminalizing laws, placing architecture that does not allow people to lay down, or removing public features that are able to aid in life-sustaining activities, such as sleeping, sitting, etc.) This is not effective in reducing the homeless population, it just creates more issues but disguised as good public deeds. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Market Data</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs states that abut 11% of the adult homeless population are veterans. In the infographic below, it shows the total number of veterans experiencing homelessness in each state in the United States from 2019. Homeless veterans are younger on average than the total veteran population. They also tend to be newly weds, so trying to manage their own income after coming back from deployment, as well as a family, can be overwhelming. In the most recent count in 2019, there was a 2.1% decrease in the estimated number of homeless Veterans nationwide and 793 veterans now have shelter, according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.

				<p>
				Tiny houses have risen in popularity due to their affordability compared to traditional housing options. It also allows for homeowners to pay off debts faster because they are not paying as much for housing and utilities because of the small amount of square footage. About 60% of tiny homeowners have no credit card debt. That can be different on a case by case study but in comparing the price of traditional homes to tiny living it makes sense. On average, a newly-built-single-family home is about $383,900 while the average cost for a customizable tiny house is $275,000 and a DIY tiny house costs about $23,000 on average, according to iProperty Management. Due to the lower overall price for the home, it allows the tiny homeowners to allocate funds elsewhere, which can be crucial for those in less stable housing environments. The infographic below, provided by Operation Tiny Home lists the benefits for living in a tiny home in terms of people currently in an unstable living situation to see the benefits of going tiny.
