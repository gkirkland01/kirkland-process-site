						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">Research describing the Determined Audiences, Operation Tiny Home's Overarching and Specific Goals.</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						<b>Determined Audiences</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing extensive research about Operation Tiny Home and their programs, I was able to distinguish who their audiences are. This research is essential in order to create an effective web design based on the understanding of thier catered audiences.
					</p>
					<p>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/audience_research.png" alt="" />
						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two audience groups for those directly involved, those giving help and those who have and will recieve help. Those giving help, would be volunteers (providing physical and financial help), benefactors (providing solely financial help), and Operation Tiny Home staff. Those having recieved help or are seeking help are veterans (Operation Tiny House offers a Veteran program), City/civil workers, as well as low-income families that are either homeless already or on the verge.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Next is the audience that is peripherally invovled, those that are impacted by this organization but is not directly targeted. That includes contrators, local and state government officials, as well as the local community members.
					</p>
					<p>
						Those are not the only audiences. There are always fans and skeptics towards any service or organization. Those for Operation Tiny Home could include the support of the tiny house community, a community that strives to help the people around them as well as the environment. Fans can also include homeless shelters as well as veteran service providers. These groups could be fans of the organization because they are all providers that seek to help their specific audiences find a stable environment. However, when the skeptics are added, both groups of skeptics and fans start to overlap. Government officials can be skeptics because of the lack of regulations for tiny houses, they can been deemed unfit places to live. Homeless shelters can also be skeptics as well as fans because funds could be taken away from them if there are less people they need to help in the community. Another group of skeptics could be the local community members of Operation Tiny Home's nationwide workshops because their property values could begin to lose value.
					</p>
					<p>
						The audiences previously mentioned have some knowledge of Operation Tiny Home but the organization is also needing the attention of some specific groups to be able to further their cause. Such as the local communinties that their workshops are hosted in to raise awareness of their homeless population in their areas and encourage support. They also need law makers to be aware of Operation Tiny Home due to the lack of regulation of tiny houses and many owners get evicted due to the lack of laws and communication. The attention of professional tiny house building companies nationwide would also help their organization reguarding relationships and partnering with them in the companies' local areas. Lastly, if Veteran Affairs knew about Operation Tiny Home then they could direct veterans in need to them and help lower the veteran homeless population.
