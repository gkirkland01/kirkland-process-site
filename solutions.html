					</header>

						<b>Style Tile</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						My redesign of Operation Tiny Home's landing page and navigation bar. The original layout was hard to navigate to get to the the viewer's intended information. To resolve this, I created a simple color hierarchy to direct audiences to the information that pertains to them. Overall simplicity became a goal for the redesign because the users were not coming to the organizations website to be wowed by design but to find information.
					</p>
					<p>
						<div class="image fit">

						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						For the overall color scheme, I wanted to stay pretty gender neutral while also utilizing colors that were not overwhelming but were distinct enough to grasp the users' attention. The overall feel that I got from who Operation Tiny Home is are described by the adjectives on the left. These were important themes for me to carry over into the site's redesign. I chose to use the typeface Azo Sans throughout the website to bring cohesion but also a sense of passion and a hint of seriousness, to really show that this organization is relational but means buisness.
					</p>
					<p> 
						<b>Call to Action</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						In reguards to the call to action, the theme of being relational was in the forefront. So instead of using action verbs I came up with statements that the members of the different audiences could relate with.
					</p>
					<p>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/cta.jpg" alt="" />
						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						The "needing help" call to action is for those seeking to be served by Operation Tiny Home. In the original web design there was not clarity in navigating the site for this audience. The call to action will be after an "I am" statement to really push the idea of relation. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The "wanting to help" call to action is for those seeking to serve Operation Tiny Home. Whether that be through volunteering their time and skills to financial donations, this call to action caters towards this audience. The original site's design mainly focused on those wanting to help or donate, but the balance for the two audiences serves the organization much better.
