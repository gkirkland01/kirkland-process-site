						<b>Most Recent News Reguarding Homelessness</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						In terms of the homeless population, the lack of a stable living environment is not their only obstacle. Finding a source of income and employment is the main obstacle that keeps the homeless from working to change their state of living. From the National Coalition for the Homeless, they state that "meaningful and sustainable employment is the key to creating and maintaining housing stability." What really helps is providing programs to connect people in unstable environments with skill training and facilitating work environment placements to give them experience to allow them to provide a steady income. Without that, providing a roof over their heads is not enough to fully remove them from the unstable living condition. However, without homes and or lack of work experience, many employers are not willing to hire. The Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program did an evaluation showing that "successful emplployment programs provide access to a wide variety of services, including housing, and assistence to help homeless individuals overcome employment barriers." Concluding that these programs have to target those who are homeless or are at risk of losing their homes. Encouraging employment and the mindset of success is what programs of this nature need to impliment in their participants to help the homeless work towards a stable living environment in the long term, rather than find a temporary solution.

						To dive into a subgroup of the homeless population, a vast majority are military veterans. Once returning home, veterans struggle with finding jobs because often times the skill sets required in deployment do not always apply to civilian jobs. This leads to struggling with finding affordable housing and facing economic turmoil. On top of that, they also face psychological obstacles brought on by extended deployments.

						<b>Most Recent News Reguarding Tiny Houses</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Tiny homes are a somewhat new housing option for those in economic hardships as well as those who want to leave a smaller environmental footprint, want to be able to travel more, want to live a minimalistic lifestyle. However, not many states know how to regulate safety measures or taxation on this style of living. The hardest part involving living in a tiny home is trying to find land that is legally able to place that small of a structure on, whether it is on a foundation or on a trailer, similar to an RV. Because of this movement's fresh nature, many states do not know how to regulate tiny houses, but states are beginning to address tiny home laws and people are able to legally live in these structures.

						<b>Recent Innovations</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Second Wind Cottages, a tiny house community that assists the homeless population in Newfield, New York opened officially, with each tiny home costing roughly $10,000 to build. According to the Charter for Compassion, it is a project that is apart of a "national movement of tiny-house villages, an alternative approach to housing the homeless that's beginning to catch the interest of national advocates and government housing officials alike." Tiny-houses are blooming across the nation to assist the homeless. In the infographic below, Yes! Magazine was able to find tiny-house communities for the homeless across the United States.

					</div>
					<p>
						Another recent development in the homeless community is an enterprise that helps house the homeless. Started by Frank Ossm, formerly homeless, started a company, 3D Print Housing Corportation, that 3D prints tiny homes for the homeless in Canada. He uses his company to "not only use 3D construction printing to make housing affordability a reality but to also use it in concert with advocacy and policy developments, hoping that this will make it easier for thought leaders to impose change for the better."

					<b>Successful and Failed Solutions</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					University of Colorado Boulder student, Andrew Heben, worked on an urban planning project called SquareOne Villages. The project provided tiny houses for over 100 homeless in Eugene, Oregon. This project came about when Heben visited a tent city in Cincinnati and saw problems that he wanted find a solution for. Currently Heben is working towards building a toolkit for helping local governments to make tiny villages a reality in more locations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Heben's solution is very similar to Operation Tiny Home's solution of providing homes and career training to build a foundation for homeless veterans.
				</p>
				<p>
					What does not work is governments banning homeless from resting in public spaces by placing criminalizing laws, placing architecture that does not allow people to lay down, or removing public features that are able to aid in life-sustaining activities, such as sleeping, sitting, etc.) This is not effective in reducing the homeless population, it just creates more issues but disguised as good public deeds. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Market Data</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs states that abut 11% of the adult homeless population are veterans. In the infographic below, it shows the total number of veterans experiencing homelessness in each state in the United States from 2019. Homeless veterans are younger on average than the total veteran population. They also tend to be newly weds, so trying to manage their own income after coming back from deployment, as well as a family, can be overwhelming. In the most recent count in 2019, there was a 2.1% decrease in the estimated number of homeless Veterans nationwide and 793 veterans now have shelter, according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.

				Tiny houses have risen in popularity due to their affordability compared to traditional housing options. It also allows for homeowners to pay off debts faster because they are not paying as much for housing and utilities because of the small amount of square footage. About 60% of tiny homeowners have no credit card debt. That can be different on a case by case study but in comparing the price of traditional homes to tiny living it makes sense. On average, a newly-built-single-family home is about $383,900 while the average cost for a customizable tiny house is $275,000 and a DIY tiny house costs about $23,000 on average, according to iProperty Management. Due to the lower overall price for the home, it allows the tiny homeowners to allocate funds elsewhere, which can be crucial for those in less stable housing environments. The infographic below, provided by Operation Tiny Home lists the benefits for living in a tiny home in terms of people currently in an unstable living situation to see the benefits of going tiny.
